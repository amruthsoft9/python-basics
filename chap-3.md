# Data Types in Python
  * Everything in Python programming is an object, and each object has its own unique identity(a type and a value).

  * There are many native(built-in) data types available in Python.

Some important are:

    * Numbers: An are integers (such as 1, 2, 3…), floats (such as 2.6, 4.8 etc), fractions (such as ½. ¾ etc) or even complex numbers.
        - int (signed integer)
        - float
        - long
        - complex
    * Sequences:
        - Strings: Sequence of Unicode characters, like an HTML document.
        - Bytes/Byte array: Any type of file.
        - Lists: An ordered sequence of values.
        - Tuples: An ordered immutable sequence of values.

    * Boolean: Holds either true or false values.
    * Sets: An unordered container of values.
    * Dictionaries: An key-paired values set in an unordered way.
