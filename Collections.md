# Collections

Lists are a container data type that acts as a dynamic array. 
The Python list type is called list. It is a type of sequence â€“ we can use it to store multiple values, and access them sequentially, by their position, or index, in the list. We define a list literal by putting a comma-separated list of values inside square brackets ([ and ]):

A list has a (current) length -- Get the length of a list with len(mylist).
A list has an order -- The items in a list are ordered, and you can think of that order as going from left to right.
A list is heterogeneous -- You can insert different types of objects into the same list.
Lists are mutable, 

```
# a list of strings
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'bison']

# a list of integers
numbers = [1, 7, 34, 20, 12]

# an empty list
my_list = []

# a list of variables we defined somewhere else
things = [
    one_variable,
    another_variable,
    third_variable, # this trailing comma is legal in Python
]

```
